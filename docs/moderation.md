# Galaxy Discord Moderation Guidelines

This community is based around the Roblox game [Galaxy](https://roblox.com/games/12426862174 "Roblox - Galaxy"). This means that our standards on the Discord cannot be any lower than our standards in-game. You are expected to be professional, independent and mature. Your job is to enforce rules, and these guidelines will explain how.

**Trial Moderators**, direct any questions to the other Moderators. They have experience and will help to support and guide you.  
**Moderators**, direct any questions to the Mod Manager.

!!! danger "Work in Progress"

    This guide is still being actively worked on, and is not quite ready yet. Report any issues to @cswimr on Discord.

## Trial Moderators

Every Moderator begins as a Trial Moderator. It is not just a role, but a period of time in which the Mod Manager will closely oversee all of your actions and determine if you are fit to be a Moderator. This evaluation period lasts for 14 days. On the final day of your evaluation period, the Mod Manager will go through your activity and determine if you should be promoted or let go. The Mod Manager may remove you before the period is up for other reasons, such as abuse of power. Questions are to be expected from you, do not be afraid to ask for help!

!!! info "Trial Moderator Permissions"

    Trial Moderators do not have the required permissions to ban or kick users. Please ask a Moderator to handle that if you're certain that a particular member deserves a ban. If you cannot wait for a response, you may shortmute the rulebreaker for up to 30 minutes so they don't cause any more trouble.

## Moderators

After passing your Trial Moderator evaluation period, you will be given the Discord Moderator role. As a Moderator, you have the ability to warn, mute, kick, and ban problematic community members. More permissions are not the only change, you will also have responsibilities to fulfill. You will be expected to enforce the Discord server's rules, according to what is outlined in these Guidelines.

### Duties

As a Moderator, you are expected to perform the following duties when required.

- Ranking community members who make a valid request in the `#!cpp #role-request` channel.
    - Delete their request after adding their role.
- Posting advertisements in the `#!cpp #group-advertising` channel, assuming the following criteria are met.
    - The advertised Discord server does not contain any content that breaks the Galaxy discord server's rules in any channels that can be seen immediately after joining or after some variety of verification process. Channels containing NSFW content are allowed **only if they are marked as Age-Restricted channels within Discord.**
    - The advertised Discord server is not a community server for another game, and it does not claim to be one.
    - The advertised Discord server is in some way related to Galaxy, whether it's a Galaxy clan or just a group of players who play Galaxy.
- Helping community members within [Support Server](https://discord.gg/ShWshkhYhZ "Join the Galaxy Support server on Discord") Tickets.

### Logging Moderations

When moderating a community member, you are expected to post the following information in the `#!cpp #mod-evidence` channel.

- **Evidence:** Image/video proof of the infraction
    - If the infraction occurred in a voice chat, you must have a video or audio recording of the infraction.
    - If the evidence violates the Discord [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms "Discord Terms of Service") or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines "Discord Community Guidelines"), **do not** post it in the `#!cpp #mod-evidence` channel. This includes things such as NSFW content, as the `#!cpp #mod-evidence` channel is not an Age-Restricted channel.
    - Not providing evidence for a moderation, unless it is a ToS / CG violation, means that the moderation is invalid and may be reverted at the Mod Manager's discretion.
- **Details:**
    - Aurora case ID
    - Your user ID
    - Target's user ID
    - Reason for moderation
    - Duration (if applicable, e.g., for bans/mutes)

??? tip "Auto Evidence Format"

    **[Aurora](https://seacogs.csw.im/aurora "SeaCogs Documentation - Aurora")** automatically generates a pre-formatted moderation log with all required details.

    **How to use:**

    1. After issuing a moderation action, Aurora will post a summary.
    2. **Copy the entire message** and paste it in `#!cpp #mod-evidence`.
    3. **Attach your evidence** (screenshots/videos) to the same message.

    ![How to submit evidence](img/moderation/logging.webp){ loading=lazy }

    <h3>Extra Details</h3>

    - Disable Auto Evidence Format:  
    ```prolog
    -aurora settings overrides
    ```
    - Manually generate a case summary:  
    ```prolog
    /case case:13,729 evidenceformat:True
    ```

### Accountability Clause

As a Moderator, you are entrusted with the authority to exercise professional judgment when addressing behaviors that violate the community's standards, even in situations not explicitly covered by these Guidelines. This discretionary power allows you to take action against harmful conduct that exploits loopholes or operates in gray areas. However, all such decisions must be grounded in observable evidence and the community's best interests, not personal biases or unfounded opinions.

If a moderation action is challenged by the affected user or fellow moderators, the case will be escalated to the Mod Manager for review. During this evaluation period, the original moderation remains in effect. Moderators acting in good faith with proper documentation will not face repercussions even if their decision is ultimately overturned. This protection ensures you can take proactive action without fear of unfair punishment.

When exercising this discretion, always prioritize transparency: thoroughly document your reasoning, preserve all relevant evidence, and when possible, seek input from other Moderators before acting.

### Potential Demotion Reasons

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- Inactivity exceeding one week without leaving a notice first.
    - Inform the Mod Manager of how long you'll be inactive and why.
    <!-- TODO: revisit this policy... I don't know how I feel about this (@cswimr) -->

## Minor Infractions

### Filter Bypasses

- **Automod Bypass**: Messages containing blacklisted words are blocked by a Discord Automod filter. Evading this filter warrants moderation.
- **Self-Censoring**: Moderated if the intended word is obvious (e.g., `c**t`).
- **Reactions/Emojis/Stickers**:
    - Combining emojis/reactions to spell out blacklisted words.
    - Using stickers with inappropriate names.
    - Apply the `Blacklist - Reactions` role alongside normal punishment if the infraction involved reactions.

- Harassment, mild threats, or disruptive behavior.
- Requesting blacklisted roles.

### Spamming / Chat Flooding

- Excessive, repetitive messages or meaningless spam.

- Racially suggestive remarks.

### Glorifying or Joking About Controversial or Tragic Historical Events

- This includes events such as the Holocaust, 9/11, the Beirut explosion, and other controversial or tragic historical events.
    - This is mostly left to the moderator's discretion.

### Advertising

- Advertising is not allowed if the content being advertised is another Discord server or if the content being advertised is unsafe for children, malicious, or breaks other rules.
    - If content violates the Terms of Service of the service it was posted on, report it to that service.
- Community members may submit a Discord server to `#!cpp #group-advertising` by creating a general support ticket in the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/ShWshkhYhZ "Join the Galaxy Support server on Discord"). See [Duties](#duties "Moderators - Duties").

- If a community member violates the Discord [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms "Discord Terms of Service") or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines "Discord Community Guidelines"), they should be permanently banned.
    - This also includes banning underage users (<13).
    - We do not punish client modification users. This is because Discord themselves do not punish users or developers of client modifications.
- Users who are banned for breaking the Discord ToS / CG should always be reported to Discord, either through right-clicking the offending message and clicking **`Report`**, or sending a report through Discord's [support portal](https://dis.gd/request "Discord Support - Submit a request").
