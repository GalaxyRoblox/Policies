## Administrative Duties

Admins monitor in-game activity to ensure fair gameplay and relative peace within the in-game chats. When refunds need to be processed, these staff members typically handle them but may request support from devs in special circumstances, depending on what happened. These instances, however, are few and far between.

Sometimes, Admins may host what are referred to as “Admin Events” where an entire server of players are united to participate in a unique event not found in normal gameplay, and often comes with reasonable rewards, but are also highly risky to participate in.

They may also involve giveaways that have rewards “poofed” in or given away by other community members, and will always involve admin ships that have zero weaponry, unless the giveaway is done via the Discord, which is then done by a bot in the server.

## Introduction

Galaxy was first introduced to Roblox on 1/13/2015 and with it, has seen a long history of updates, history, joy and anger. From the first player created clans such as OP (Otaku Pirates), OP18 (Outpost 18), ToS (Titans of Space) to the later clans such as Lunar Cloud, PMC and a few others, there is a lot of information that the Administration Team has to be aware of, understand and discuss for everything done. Some refunds done follow the guidelines created in the time period where the kill happened, which could date years back, and it is the Admin’s job to understand those past guidelines and be flexible enough to work within them when needed, while still conforming to the current standards created by the Admin Director at the time.
